# Enso - A Virtual Zen Garden

Enso is an interactive Zen Garden experience. Designed using the principles of DBT and Zazen, it was initially built as a mental health aid to be used in theraputic contexts. However, over the development process, I found that it was fun for everyone and decided to make it publicly available for free.

Enso features a variety of plants, rocks, and rakes that are progressively unlocked as you play. To give users a connection to the outdoors, the visual environment reflects the actual weather using geolocation and OpenWeatherMap.

Enso is available for free forever at
